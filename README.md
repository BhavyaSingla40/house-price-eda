\##  Key Analysis Performed

\- Distribution analysis of house prices  

\- Correlation analysis between numerical features  

\- Relationship between median income and house value  

\- Geographic visualization of house prices using latitude and longitude  

\- Comparison of house prices based on proximity to the ocean

\##  Key Insights

\- Median income shows a strong positive correlation with median house value  

\- Houses located near the ocean generally have higher prices  

\- Geographic location plays a significant role in determining house prices  

\- House age has a weaker influence compared to income and location
